            <h1 class="text-primary mb-3">About the Elemental Planes</h1>
            <div class="pl-4">
                <p>The world this ARPG is set in is known as the Elemental Planes (occasionally shortened to just "the Planes"). The Elemental Planes is like a multiversal hub that regulates the magic of every universe, and as such it is inhabited by creatures from many different kinds of worlds. As its name suggests, this world consists of several planes that are like different "sub-worlds" of which each is dedicated to a specific element of magic. These planes are connected to one another by magical portals.</p>
                <p>There are eight planes that make up the Elemental Planes, one for each element plus one neutral one. Below are some basic descriptions of what these elemental planes look like.
                
                    <ul>
                        <li><b class="text-primary">The Elemental Plane of Earth</b> is dedicated to rocks, sand, plants, fungi, gemstones, ores, metals, and other earthy things. The plane itself is like an endless cavern system, with winding tunnels and large open spaces that act as towns or cities.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-primary">The Elemental Plane of Fire</b> is dedicated to fire, lava, magma, and other things with intensely hot temperatures. The landscape of this plane is barren and rocky, with volcanoes and lakes of lava or magma dotting the lands.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-primary">The Elemental Plane of Matter</b> is dedicated to flesh, bones, blood, organs, and other bodily things. This plane consists largely of jungles full fleshy or boney plants. This plane is as dangerous as it is unsettling, since most of its plants are carnivorous and have maws full of razor-sharp teeth.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-primary">The Elemental Plane of Null</b> was dedicated to time. It was once a lively place, but that was before the Mage Guild attacked. Now its desert-like landscape is filled with ruins, memories of a time that will never return. This plane is off-limits because it is extremely dangerous, as the so-called time-storms that happen in this plane can age or de-age someone out of existence.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-primary">The Elemental Plane of Void</b> is dedicated to light, darkness, illusions, and many other things that can mess with one's mind. This plane is like a forest with stars and galaxies in its foliage, with castles made of dark stone dappled across landscape. It's always night over here.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-primary">The Elemental Plane of Water</b> is dedicated to water, ice, aquatic animals, and other water-related things. The plane itself is fully submerged in water, with pockets of breathable air surrounding most of the towns and cities. This elemental plane is home to some of the biggest and most influential gangs in all of the Planes, so beware if you don't want to end up sleeping with the fishes.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-primary">The Elemental Plane of Wind</b> is dedicated to air, clouds, storms, and other air-related things. It consists of many floating islands, and while some of them connected by bridges and such, most islands can only be accessed through flight. Luckily there's plenty of flying carriages that act as taxis of sorts.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-primary">The Foundry</b> is the elementally neutral plane that connects the other planes with one another. It is a large city with different districts dedicated to the different elements as well as plenty of space for those who aren't necessarily aligned with any element. The Foundry also hosts the headquarters of the Elemental Alliance.</li>
                    </ul>

        <div class="card p-md-5 p-4">
            <h1 class="text-primary mb-3">The Elemental Alliance</h1>
            <div class="pl-4">
                <p>The Elemental Alliance (also known as simply "the Alliance") is an organization within the Elemental Planes that strives to keep the Planes safe. It acts like an "adventurers' guild" of sorts, recruiting those who want to help out the citizens of the Planes. The Alliance was initially formed in an attempt to support and help citizens with small things after the Mage Guild essentially destroyed the Elemental Plane of Null. Over time it has grown into a much bigger organization, they're still helping out civilians with their personal things but they also work a much bigger scale if needed.</p>
            <p>The Elemental Alliance is split into four different divisions: Combat, Magic, Social, and Knowledge. Each division is named after its main specialty in training. Members of the Alliance get to choose which division they want to be part of when they initially sign up.</p>
